## About The Project

This application was created to train a user mental (addition, substraction, division and multiplication) by generating random number of the user choices. 
The main reason I created this application because I am unable to find an application for myself to train my mental divisiona and multiplication for large numbers
because most of the application in the App Store on mental sum was created for children. This App was created for Adult in mind. Thefore, the user interface was 
designed like a calculator instead of the kid / cartoon design.
